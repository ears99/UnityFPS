# UnityFPS
This is a simple program that demonstrates how to use raycasting to 
implement a first person shooter (FPS) system. 

# Where did you get the assets for the guns?
I got them from a website called devassets.com, hosted by Brackeys. I got them
for free, and they're high quality; I highly reccommend Brackeys for Unity
tutorials, and for free assets! (And no, they're not paying me to say that.)
